//! Smart Keymap library.
//!
//! A "smart keyboard" is a keyboard where the keys can perform
//!  multiple actions, depending on the context.
//! Features such as layering, tap-hold, and tap-dance are
//!  examples of smart keyboard functionality.
//!
//! The smart keymap library provides an interface for the "smart keymap"
//!  part of smart keyboard firmware.
//! i.e. the part that takes key presses and releases as input,
//!  and outputs HID keyboard reports (or other smart keyboard outputs).
//!
//! This crate is to be built as a C library.
//!
//! # Usage as a C library
//!
//! ## Custom Keymap
//!
//! When used as a C library, the library should be built by setting
//!  the environment variable `SMART_KEYMAP_CUSTOM_KEYMAP` to the path
//!  of a custom keymap file.
//!
//! The most user friendly way to do this is to use `ncl/keymap-codegen.ncl`
//!  to produce a `keymap.rs` file from a `keymap.json` file.
//!
//! ## Keyboard Firmware Implementation
//!
//! When used as a C library, the firmware should call to
//!  `keymap_init`, `keymap_register_input_keypress`, `keymap_register_input_keyrelease`,
//!  and `keymap_tick` functions.
//! The `keymap_tick` function should be called every ms, and should copy the
//!  HID keyboard report to the given buffer.
